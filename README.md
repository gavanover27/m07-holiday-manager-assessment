# m07-holiday-manager-assessment

# These files show the in depth process of the holiday manager assessment as part of the Genesis10 Dev10 Bootcamp.
# These files hold the names and dates for the holidays from 2020 to 2024

# holiday-manager-assessment-code.py is the final, finished, python file
  # Two classes are created within the code, Holiday and HolidayList
  # The code both reads and writes to JSON files
  # There is a main menu, consisting of 5 options for the user to choose from.
  # The user can add or remove holidays from a list, search for holidays by week number and year, save their changes to a JSON file, and exit the program
  # The code also uses beautiful soup to scrape https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/2022 for the holidays and their dates

# results.json is the save destination for the code
# holiday.json is the initial file with the 7 starting holidays
